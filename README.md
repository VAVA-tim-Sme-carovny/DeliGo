# 🏦 DeliGo - Tracking system Application  

## 📌 Overview  

**DeliGo** is a Tracking system  designed to help staff track, order and manage their created orders. It is built with a **Java com.deligo.Backend (BE)**, a **Java FX (FE)**, and a **REST API** for seamless communication between the two. The project follows a **modular architecture**, allowing for independent development of components.  

**For following project you will have to use explicitly Open JDK 21 or Oracle JDK 21  - other versions like Amazon Coretto wont work !!! Set all settings for you running Java version**

---

## Requiremetns

- Java openJDK 21 (not correto or any other version)

 - Setup java to enviroment variable JAVA_HOME

- Make sure your Idea Intelij uses 21 version even in run configurations

---

## 🔀 Branch Naming Convention  

When creating new branches, follow these naming patterns:  

- `feature/<feature-name>` → For new features (e.g., `feature/user-auth`)  
- `bugfix/<bug-description>` → For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-error`)  
- `hotfix/<urgent-fix>` → For urgent patches (e.g., `hotfix/urgent-patch`)  

---

## Build profiles
There are 3 main profiles:
### - Development Build - Starts frontend and backend
### - BackEnd Build - starts backend without frontend
### - FrontEnd Build - starts frontend without backend

---

## 📦 Dependency & Environment Versioning  

DeliGo is built using **Maven** to manage dependencies and version control.

# 🛠 Java version setup
To check current version use:
- java --version
OR
- /usr/libexec/java_home -V

If you are using OpenJKD23 or other use:
- brew uninstall openjdk
- brew install openjdk@21

To set correct version as default
- export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)
- echo 'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)' >> ~/.zshrc
- source ~/.zshrc


### 🔹 Dependency Lock
All dependencies are locked using Maven’s dependency lock mechanism, generating a `dependency-lock.json` file that is committed to GitHub.  

### 🔹 Maven Wrapper
DeliGo is executed via Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) to ensure consistent builds across environments.

# GitHub tutorial
If you are trying to pull a branch, first push your current changes so you wont lose any progress and then pull the new one.

### PLEASE DO NOT PUSH ANYTHING TO MAIN BRANCH & ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN RIGHT BRANCH 
check branch
```sh
git status
```
pull the lastest changes
```sh
git fetch
git pull
```
switch to main branch
```sh
git checkout main
```
merge latest changes
```sh
git merge origin/main
```
add and push changes
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updated configurations and removed unnecessary files"
git push origin feature/XXX
```


# Problems with wrapper
check mvn skript issues
```sh
chmod -x mvnw
chmod +x .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
```
test check
```sh
./mvnw -v
```

## 🔄 GitHub & Git Configuration commands
GitHub now does not support password authentication for git fetch and git push. You must use SSH:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Save it in : ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Now add SSH key to your GitHub (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent):
```sh
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

-Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH & GPG keys → New SSH Key
-Paste the copied key and save it.

Now check connection:
-ssh -T git@github.com

Change remote to SHH:
-git remote set-url origin git@github.com:VAVA-tim-Sme-carovny/DeliGo.git


### 🛠️ Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

## 🔒 SSL Configuration

DeliGo supports secure communication between frontend and backend using HTTPS. Follow these steps to enable SSL:

### 1. Generate a Self-Signed Certificate (Development Only)

Run the provided script to generate a self-signed certificate:

```sh
./generate-certificate.sh
```

This will create a `deligo.p12` keystore file in the project root directory.

### 2. Configure SSL Settings

The SSL settings are already configured in `config.properties`:

```properties
# SSL Configuration
SSL_ENABLED=true
SSL_KEYSTORE_PATH=deligo.p12
SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=deliGoPassword
```

You can modify these settings if needed.

### 3. Production Deployment

For production environments:
- Obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority
- Update the keystore path and password in `config.properties`
- Ensure proper certificate validation in the client code

> ⚠️ **Note**: The current implementation includes code to trust all certificates in development mode. This should be removed in production for security reasons.
